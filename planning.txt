Weather API
- DarkSky
  - Documentation looks to be most complete, good free-teir, and simple pricing (if needed)
  - Super simple web API call
  - Plenty of data for what I need
  - One thing it's missing is getting data by city/state, requires lat/long
- OpenWeather
  - Documentation looks pretty good, not great 
  - Offers current weather data and a simple 5 day forecast
  - 60 calls per min should be plenty for dev work
  - Can get weather info by city/state or zip

Stack
- Spring Boot on BE 
- MySQL for the DB
- React on the FE
